Description
Olympics-Route-Add-On
For this add on, the client should be provided 5 buttons (one for each sport). When a given button is clicked, the random use generated by your server should be displayed in the ng-view (just as we did in class). Again the requirements should be the same as our previous app, just with the new addition of routes. Please push this code to a new repo with the name above
